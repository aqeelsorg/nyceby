The 7.8-inch tablet&#8217;s second edition is virtually identical inside and out to the 9.7-inch iPad Air, with the obvious exception of size and weight.</p>

<p>Both tablets have a powerful, dual-core A7 chip, an M7 motion coprocessor, a 1.2-megapixel, 720p FaceTime camera, a 5-megapixel, 1080p iSight camera, MIMO Wi-Fi technology, a single radio for all bands of LTE (if you buy the 4G model) and Retina display.</p>

<p>The iPad mini Retina also has the same resolution as the iPad Air, but naturally, in a smaller frame. What happens when you squeeze a 2,048 x 1,536-pixel resolution into a 7.9-inch display? You get a whopping 326 pixels per inch. In comparison, the iPad Air only offers 264 ppi. The mini’s resolution actually beats Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire HDX 7-inch, which boasts 323 ppi in its 1,920 x 1,200-pixel resolution screen.</p>

<p>Of course, if you’re counting a few pixels, you may be missing the big picture, which is that all of these new tablets have high-resolution and very attractive screens.</p><?php  /* end template body */
